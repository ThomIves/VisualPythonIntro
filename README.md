# Visual Python Introduction
An introduction to visual python for visualizing elements of predictive modeling in general

![Visual Python Intro Logo](https://github.com/ThomIves/VisualPythonIntro/blob/master/vp_anima.gif)
> An initial example of how Visual Python can be used to assist in predictive modeling efforts in general.

This code accompanies the blog post [Visual Python: Versatile Programmatic Module For 3D Animations](https://integratedmlai.com/visual-python-intro/).

## Getting started

1. This code accompanies the blog post [Visual Python: Versatile Programmatic Module For 3D Animations](https://integratedmlai.com/visual-python-intro/), and it is best to walk through this code from there.
2. Pendulumns.py contains all the code that you will need.
3. The remaining files present simply support the blog post. For example, there are some visual python primatives to practice with. There is a video file that was a screen capture of a Visual Python animation of the 20 pendulums in Pedulumns.py, etc.
4. Visual Python can best be learned from [The Visual Python Web Page](https://vpython.org/)
